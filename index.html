    <h4> here are actually three glass beaches  — all former city trash dump sites — that are layered with beautiful sea glass. Search for rare ruby reds (from pre-1967 auto tail lights) or sapphire gems from apothecary bottles. Snap a photo, but leave the glass behind for others to discover. From 1906 to 1967, everything from cars to batteries to bottles, cans, and appliances were unceremoniously pushed over the cliffs into the ocean — a common practice of seaside cities for centuries. Mother Nature responded to this abuse with a nice surprise in the form of smooth, colored sea glass treasure in a rainbow of colors. Best Picnic Spot: On the rocks and cliffs overlooking Glass Beach #3 (the most northern of the three beaches; located in MacKerricher State Park).</h4></center>

          <center><p>Glass Beach is a beach adjacent to MacKerricher State Park near 
          Fort Bragg, California, named from a time when it was abundant 
          with sea glass created from years of dumping garbage into 
          an area of coastline near the northern part of the town</p></center>
